## Hi there 👋

My name is Ana, and I am a mechanical engineer currently pursuing postgraduate studies in software development`💻`. My journey into the world of engineering began with a deep curiosity about how things work, which led me to earn a degree in mechanical engineering.
I am dedicated to my field and driven by a relentless curiosity and eagerness to learn. My goal is to contribute to groundbreaking projects that make a significant impact on society.

Outside of my professional life, I am an avid reader `📖` and a passionate traveler `✈️. Reading broadens my perspective and provides a continuous source of knowledge and inspiration. Traveling allows me to explore different cultures, experience diverse lifestyles, and gain new insights that enrich both my personal and professional life.
