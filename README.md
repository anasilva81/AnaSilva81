## Hi there 👋

My name is Ana, and I am a recent postgraduate in software development, now an intern in data engineering💻. My journey into the world of engineering began with a deep curiosity about how things work, which initially led me to study mechanical engineering. However, my evolving interests and desire to impact society through technology steered me towards software development and data engineering. I am driven by a relentless curiosity and eagerness to learn, aiming to contribute to groundbreaking projects that make a significant impact on society.

Outside of my professional life, I am an avid reader `📖` and a passionate traveler `✈️. Reading broadens my perspective and provides a continuous source of knowledge and inspiration. Traveling allows me to explore different cultures, experience diverse lifestyles, and gain new insights that enrich both my personal and professional life.
